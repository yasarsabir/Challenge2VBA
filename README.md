# Challenge2VBA
Week2 VBA challenge
In this challenge we had to create functions to scroll through stocks to identify all the different stocks, then calculate 
their opening and closing market values for the year. 
I then calculated the percentage change in the stock value
I then sorted through those 3000 values to identify the highest and lowest stock percentage changes and the highest stock change
I also had to apply conditional formating to the percentage changes. 


I had a tutorial form Justin Moore to help me, he didn't write the code for me, but helped me to help myself write the code.
